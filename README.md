This is my first Odin project. It is a recipes website consisting of just HTML code(for now) during which i intend on demonstrating all the skills i have learned so far 

including HTML boilerplate, different HTML elements and so on.
 I have created a main index page in the main odin recipes directory as well as a recipes directory which includes three different recipes pages all linked to the main index page. 

I have now added some CSS to my page to give a bit of a style. every HTML file has been linked to the external CSS file called style.css.
